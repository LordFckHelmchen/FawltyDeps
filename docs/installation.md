## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation

The library is distributed with PyPI, so simply:

```sh
pip install fawltydeps
```

or any other way to install Python packages from PyPI should be enough to make it available in your environment.

Consider adding `fawltydeps` to your development dependencies, to help you catch undeclared and unused dependencies in your projects.
