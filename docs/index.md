# FawltyDeps

FawltyDeps is an open-source Python tool that checks your dependencies to ensure they are being used correctly. It helps you identify any dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` that are not actually used in your codebase, and vice versa.

## Features

- Detect unused dependencies
- Identify missing dependencies
- Supports multiple project structures

## Why FawltyDeps?

Dependency management is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase. Over time, unused dependencies can accumulate, leading to bloated environments, longer installation times, and potential security risks. FawltyDeps helps keep your project clean and efficient.
